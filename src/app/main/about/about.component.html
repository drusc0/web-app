      Hobbies
    </h5>
    <p class="card-text text-light">
      My diverse cultural background and need to be in touch with people led me to join a Latin dance group in the DC Metro Area in 2012. Thanks to this experience, I was able to join the George Mason University Salsa Club Performance Team. In 2014, I traveled to Cuba on a cultural exchange trip focused on various styles of Cuban dance. When I joined Intel in 2016, I noticed that there was no Cuban Salsa community in the South Bay Area. I have started teaching Cuban Salsa to a group of about 15-20 coworkers. We are collaborating with Rueda con Ritmo, a Cuban Salsa group from SF, to bring Cuban culture & dance to the South Bay Area.
